# Attention-based CNN-LSTM and XGBoost hybrid model for stock prediction

## Requirements

The code has been tested running under Python 3.7.4, with the following packages and their dependencies installed:
```
numpy==1.16.5
scikit-learn==0.21.3
statsmodels==0.10.1
pandas==0.25.1
tensorflow==2.1.0
keras==2.3.1
xgboost==1.5.0
```

## Usage

Firstly, run `ARIMA.py` for pre-processing step by ARIMA model. Then, run the neural network or XGBoost models.
- Run `LSTM.py` for the single-layer LSTM, multi-layer LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM models.
- Run `XGBoost.py` for the XGBoost model.
- Run `Main.py` for our proposed Attention-based CNN-LSTM and XGBoost hybrid model.



## Remark

Calling `get_apple_data.py` requires a higher version of Python, so if you need to get Apple stock data yourself, you need to create a new Python environment and use the **latest version** of Python.
